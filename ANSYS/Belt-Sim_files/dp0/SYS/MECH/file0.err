 Material number 10 (used by element 1191) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 1999).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.641   TIME= 06:11:15
 For element 1192 the element connectivity is 0 and 1998.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.641   TIME= 06:11:15
 For element 1191 the element connectivity is 0 and 1996.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.875   TIME= 06:11:16
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
