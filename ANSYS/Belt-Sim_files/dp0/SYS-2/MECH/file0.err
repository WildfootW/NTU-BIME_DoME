 Material number 10 (used by element 3191) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.734   TIME= 13:44:04
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 5697).                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.672   TIME= 13:44:11
 For element 3191 the element connectivity is 0 and 5694.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.672   TIME= 13:44:11
 For element 3192 the element connectivity is 0 and 5696.  The node      
 which is identified as a 0 will be a grounded node.                     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.000   TIME= 13:44:11
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
